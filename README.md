# getUserMedia-multiple-camera

A getUserMedia demo to open multiple cameras in one page.

[Dynamsoft Barcode Reader](https://www.dynamsoft.com/barcode-reader/overview/) is used to scan barcodes.

Demos:

)

## Requirements

You need localhost or HTTPS to have the camera permission.

You cannot open two cameras with `getUserMedia` at the same time on Android and iOS.

The demo works fine on PC devices.
